# Snake_Game
This is a basic 90's game which I learned from Udemy
This program has 4 sections
The main section deals with importing derived classes and controling what's happening on the screen.
The snake is basically made of turtles using for loop
The snake class creates a snake and moves the snake. It also extends the length of the snake when it grabs a food particle.It also has the memeber functions for moving the snake.
The food class creates a turtle that upadates it's position using random module after the snake has eaten the food.
The scoreboard class updates the scores when the snake hits the boundary or when it hits it's tail.
